* freedesktop-shared-mime

=Node= MIME library uses [[http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/shared-mime-info/][FreeDesktop shared-mime-info]] as database.
* FreeDesktop Shared MIME Info

=FreeDesktop shared mime info= contains a large number of common MIME types,
created by converting the existing KDE and GNOME databases to the new format and
merging them together. This database is more suitable for =nodejs= desktop
applications.

This package's building process converts =freedesktop.org.xml.in= to a =JSON=
data file.

*No =Charsets= info are available*

* Install

: npm install freedesktop-shared-mime

* Usage

The library interface is similar to [[https://github.com/jshttp/mime-types][mime-types]], with freedesktop-specific
features like:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  var shared_mime = require('freedesktop-shared-mime')

  shared_mime.supertype("application/epub+zip")         // "application/zip"

  shared_mime.comment("application/x-jbuilder-project") // "JBuilder project"

  shared_mime.generic_icon("application/rss+xml") // "text-html"
#+END_SRC

* TODO Remainings

** Better README
Do we have to use =md= format?

** tests
use =Istanbul= or others for coverage tests.
